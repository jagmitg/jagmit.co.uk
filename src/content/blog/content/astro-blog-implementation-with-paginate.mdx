Recently, I embarked on the task of setting up a blog on my personal website, choosing the Astro framework as the framework of choice. For those unfamiliar with it, Astro is a modern front-end framework that provides the ability to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. As I explored its capabilities, I found myself delving deep into its TypeScript integration.

## The Challenge

Building any feature-rich blog system presents a range of challenges, from sorting posts by date to ensuring a SEO-friendly URL structure. In my case, I faced the following hurdles:

1. **Pagination**: Splitting up my posts so that they aren't all displayed on one massive page.
2. **Generating Slugs for URLs**: Crafting neat, descriptive, and SEO-friendly URLs for each blog post.
3. **Filtering Out Drafts**: Only showing published posts, leaving drafts out of the public eye.
4. **Sorting by Date**: Presenting the most recent content at the top of the list.

## Implementation

Let's examine a crucial piece of the TypeScript code that powers this blog setup:

<code data-gist-id="1d6c046c0c3c69b0aac033773631501d"></code>

- **Astro Globbing**: The function starts by fetching all markdown and MDX files from the content directory using Astro.glob(). This provides a list of all potential posts.

- **Slugify Function**: A helper function named slugify takes a file path and returns a clean, URL-friendly slug. This ensures our URLs are tidy and descriptive.

- **Formatting the Posts**: With the use of map, filter, and sort, the code then transforms the raw list of posts. It generates the slug, filters out drafts using the `frontmatter.isDraft `property, sorts them by date, and finally reverses the order to show the newest first.

- **Pagination**: The paginate function is then utilised to split the sorted and filtered posts into pages, ensuring no more than 5 posts are displayed on a single page.

- This function, `getStaticPaths`, is used within the `[...page].astro` file, providing it with the necessary information to render the posts correctly and elegantly.
